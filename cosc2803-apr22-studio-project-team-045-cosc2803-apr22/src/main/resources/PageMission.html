            <p> To address the social challenge of Homelessness in Australia, we will need to 
                acknowledge that it is a problem and try to bring awareness to this issue in our society. 
            <br>
            <br>
                By creating this website, we are actively striving to break the stigma surrounding 
                homelessness and to bring this issue into the public eye. We would like to achieve 
                this by allowing the user to easily access data & statistics in multiple forms such 
                as graphs and charts that are simple to understand. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We are hoping to present a range of statistics in an easy to understand way, that are both 
            accurate and accessible for the general public. 
            <br>
            <br>
                We would like numerous users to 
                be able to access and understand our website, but particularly those who are looking to 
                learn more about homelessness and have a greater understanding of how big the issue                has become in Australia. We would also like to provide a range of statistics for 
                those who are studying and going in depth about the issue to provide information 
                to the public.
